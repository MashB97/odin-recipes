Welcome to my first project created while following The Odin Project! This project marks the beginning of my journey into web development with this fantastic resource. I chose to embark on this path to turn my passion into a rewarding career. In this project, I took my first steps with HTML. This is just the beginning of a long journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills.
